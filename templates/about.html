      <h1 class="display-3">Welcome to Priyanshu Cart!</h1>
      <p>Priyanshu Cart Pvt Ltd. is a leading Indian electronic commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. Founded by
        Priyanshu Rohella in 2007, our journey began with a passion for books. Over the years, we have expanded our
        horizons to include a diverse range of products, from consumer electronics to fashion and lifestyle items.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers, with a focus on quality,
        affordability, and customer satisfaction. At Priyanshu Cart, we believe in the power of choice, and we strive to
        offer a wide selection of products to meet the varied needs of our customers.</p>
      <p>As we grew, we faced fierce competition from global giants like Amazon and domestic rivals like Snapdeal.
        Despite the challenges, Priyanshu Cart has established itself as a dominant force in India's e-commerce
        landscape. By March 2017, we held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. Our strength lies in the
        sale of apparel, bolstered by our acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com, and we are on par with Amazon in the
        sale of electronics and mobile phones.</p>
      <p>In addition to our e-commerce platform, we also own PhonePe, a revolutionary mobile payments service based on
        the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), making transactions easier and more secure for our customers.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, our journey took a significant turn when U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77%
        controlling stake in Priyanshu Cart for US$16 billion, valuing our company at $22 billion. This partnership has
        further strengthened our capabilities and has provided us with the resources to enhance our services and reach
        even more customers.</p>
      <p>Join us on our journey as we continue to innovate and provide the best online shopping experience in India.</p>
